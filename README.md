# Chess
> :warning: **Abandoned Project**: This project has been abandoned due to me writing code that's bad. I'm currently rewriting it in Java instead, and hopefully have cleaner code. The new chess repository should be my GitHub page, under the name of *Chess*. If you want to work on this, go ahead. I was last working on adding check/checkmate system and fixing any bugs that existed in the pieces movement system.

Chess in Python. (<i>The title explains itself</i>)
